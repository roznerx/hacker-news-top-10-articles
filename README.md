# "Show top 10 articles from Hacker News" for the "React Practice Calendar" challenge by reactpractice.dev 

Made by **roznerx** (ignaciorosner@gmail.com)

- Fifth day of the calendar, this time doing this fun memory game
- So far, the easiest one, although a good challenge for consuming APIs and refreshing how to return many promises with JS methods such as **Promise.all()**
- Just like before, copied the main branch of the repo provided by the challenge to avoid looking at the provided solution!
- Only a main branch and a VERY simple design; no UI whatsoever as it is not requested (might revisit this later though!)

**NOTE:** didn't feel like adding some extra work on the UI as I do these kind of stuff on a daily basis
